We do not collect any personal information or IPs or use any tracking technologies. 

The only info we keep is your Slack workspace access code and team id; if you no longer wish the app to access your workspace, simply deactivate the app via Slack.

We do not keep a permanent record of any of the links you post, the app simply passes through the link request and returns the results. 

Slack links, messages, and identifiers can possibly be logged in case of required debugging and are retained for up to 30 days.

The app will only interact with links from BlueSky Social and will ignore all other links.
